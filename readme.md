A slideshow discussing how javascript scope works. Covers scope, pure functions, closures, and `this`.

## TODO 
* Consider creating abbreviated slideshow
* Write speaking notes for "freeform" section
* Either visualize the composable object section, or write different composable objects that are easily visualized
* Images for last 2 slides
