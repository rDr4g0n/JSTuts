## Scope ain't so hard, bra.

Javascript handles scope by defining a function environment each time a function is called (Note: function-level, not block-level).

	function add(a, b){
		return a + b;
	}

	> add(10, 4);
	< 14

The environment of this function call can be rougly represented as:

	{
		a: 10,
		b: 4
	}

**This is a pure function* because all of its variables are defined (or bound) inside of the function's environment.**

.tiny[*Technically pure functions also produce no side effects, but for this presentation the looser definition is fine.]

---

## Pure functions are a beautiful thing.

Keeping everything inside of the function environment has a lot of benefits.

* Guaranteed to always produce the same results, given the same input
* Easy to test
* Very portable/reusable
* Ideal utility functions

.center[![](1.png)]

However, it's not really reasonable to only write pure functions in javascript, but its a good goal to strive towards!

---

## IMPURE! UNCLEAN!

	function addZ(a, b){
		return a + b + z;
	}

This function access a variable, `z` that is not bound inside of it's own environment. Therefore the output of this function is not predictable without knowledge outside of this function's environment.

Let's assume `z` is defined *somewhere* and it's value is `10`.

	> addZ(10, 4);
	< 24

But suppose something happens and `z` is changed to "blorgis".

	> addZ(10, 4);
	< 14blorgis

Wut.

---

## Kids, go ask your parents first.

Speaking of environment... what does `addZ()`'s look like?

	{
		__parentEnvironment__: {
			z: 10
		}
		a: 10,
		b: 4
	}

The variable `z` isn't in the function environment, so javascript automatically goes up to the en*closing* environment, and looks for `z` there. If it can't find `z` there, it will go to its parent's parent, and so on till it hits the top (`global` in nodejs or `window` in the browser) where it will throw a `Reference Error` if the variable does not exist.

> `__parentEnvironment__` is just the way I am informally defining whichever environment encloses this one.

---

## Oh yeah, closures. Forgot about that.

	function addZ(a, b){
		return a + b + z;
	}

The variable `z` is not bound in this function's environment, so it accesses its parent's. It can be said that it *closes over* its parent's scope. **A function in javascript that is not *pure* is effectively a *closure***. However, be aware:

* a closure function can produce different results with the same arguments
* closure functions can be harder to test
* closure functions are significantly more flexible

To make a function a closure, simply access a variable outside of its environment. Javascript don't care. In fact javascript will help you out by keeping the parent environment alive, even if the parent function has completed execution.

> Keep in mind, since any function can be a closure, any function can hold onto memory that it may not need. Be careful not to create closures unless you absolutely need to.

---

## Behold, the closure in its natural habitat

Javascript doesn't like syncronous execution. Pretty often javascript is just waiting around for an event to fire or an async operation to complete. Take a looksie here bro:

    function postLog(username, pass, logTxt){

		var uri = "log/" + username;

		var onComplete = function(id){
			console.log(
				"log for", username,
				"was successfully posted to", uri,
				"with id", id);
		};

		Federation.post(uri, pass, logTxt, onComplete);

		console.log("postLog execution complete.");

    }

Let's assume Federation.post() is an async function that posts to some REST API or something.

---

## Ya know what async is, right?

	// not the nicest interface :/
	postLog("jkirk", "OhuraOhYes",
		"Captain's Log, Stardate 1329.8. The USS Enterprise 
		in pursuit of an unidentified vessel.");

What output might you expect to see in the console? SSHHHHhhhhh... shhhh. don't answer.

	< postLog execution complete.
	< log for jkirk was successfully posted to log/jkirk with id 9

What the double backflip. How can `postLog` finish execution *before* it actually posted?!

Because *async*, that's why (hoping you guys already know what's up with async vs sync).

---

## So async, so what.

Well here's where I was going with this. `postLog()` was done. gone. finished. closed. ex-parrot. Yet somehow the callback function, `onComplete()`, magically had access to `postLog()`'s `username` and `uri`. But, but, you might say, those vars should have closed along with `postLog()`!

**`onComplete()` *closed over* `postLog()`'s function environment, thus keeping it alive after execution ended.** `onComplete()`'s' environment could be represented like this:

	__onCompleteEnvironment__: {
		__closured__postLogEnvironment__: {
			username: "jkirk",
			pass: "OhuraOhYes",
			logTxt: "Captain's Log, Star...",
			uri: "log/jkirk"
		}
		id: "12345678"
	}

It keeps a copy of its enclosing environment, thus it always has access to the variables it needs.

---

## Can you make it more complex please?

Yes. Yes I can.

`postLog()` is not easy to use. It requires a username and password to be included with every call. Let's abstract this mug. We can write a function that accepts a username and password and returns a new function with the username and password prefilled.

	function bindCredentials(type, username, pass){

		var uri = type +"/"+ username;

		return function(logTxt){
			Federation.post(uri, pass, logTxt, function(id){
				console.log("log for", username,
					"was successfully posted to", uri,
					"with id", id);
			});
			console.log("credential bound function execution complete");
		};
	}


---

## Step 3: Profit!

We use it like this

	var captainsLog = bindCredentials("log", "jkirk", "OhuraOhYes");
	captainsLog("Captain's log, stardate 9522.6: I've
		never trusted Klingons, and I never will.");

Now anytime Cap needs to log stuff, he can just call `captainsLog()` and skip all the credentials. And to help unwrap this puzzle a bit, here's what the execution environment looks like:

	__postEnvironment__: {
		__captainsLog__: {
			__bindCredentialsEnvironment__: {
				type: "log",
				username: "jkirk",
				pass: "OhuraOhYes",	
				uri: "log/jkirk"
			}
			logTxt: "Captain's log, star..."
		}
		id: "..."
	}

---

## Magic and invocation

When `bindCredentials()` was invoked, it created a new closure with access to `username` and `pass`. Then, `captainsLog()` added `logTxt` to that environment, and finally `post()` added `id`. 

The important bit is this: **No matter where a closure is called, it will have access to the environment where it was defined.**

That's why all of the following invocations of `captainsLog()` work identically:

	captainsLog("Captain's log, additional entry. Since our
		mission was routine, we had beamed down to the planet
		without suspicion.");

	captainUtils.captainsLog = captainsLog;
	captainUtils.captainsLog("Captain's log, Stardate 1513.1.
		Our position, orbiting planet M-113.");

	captainsLog.call(null, "Captain's log, Stardate 1513.4. One
		crewman, member of the landing party, dead by violence.");

---

## Exposing Secrets

Closures can be used to access a function's environment from outside of the function:

	var ninjaFunction;

	function kirksSecret(){

		var secret = "Be William Shatner.";

		ninjaFunction = function(){
			return secret;
		};

	}

Variable `ninjaFunction` is declared at the global scope in this example, but defined inside of `kirksSecret()`. Since `ninjaFunction()` was defined in an environment with access to `secret`, `ninjaFunction()` can get to the secret.

	kirksSecret(); //=> undefined
	ninjaFunction(); //=> "Be William Shatner"

---

## Keeping your privates private

Javascript doesn't have the concept of private members built in, but it can be approximated using closures. In fact, we have already done this with `bindCredentials()`.

	function bindCredentials(type, username, pass){

		var uri = type +"/"+ username;

		return function(logTxt){
			Federation.post(uri, pass, logTxt, function(id){
				console.log("log for", username,
					"was successfully posted to", uri,
					"with id", id);
			});
			console.log("credential bound function execution complete");
		};
	}

The function that `bindCredentials()` returns has access to `uri` and `pass`, but no other entity can access those values. They are effectively private to the returned function.

---

## Recap

#### Pure functions
* Pure functions have all of their vars bound in the current functions environment
* Pure functions are portable and easy to test, but not too flexible.

.center[![](5.png)]

#### Closure functions
* Accessing a var outside of the current function environment creates a closure
* Closures are highly flexible and useful, but can be more challenging to debug and test
* A closure's scope is determined by where it is defined, not where it is called.
* A closure keeps any parent scope it needs access to alive, even when that parent function has closed.

## It's like `this` and like that

Unlike a closure environment, the `this` context is determined by *how* a function is called. Here are the 4 ways `this` is set:

1. when using the `new` keyword
	* `new doThing();`
2. via call or apply
	* `doThing.call(myObj);`
	* `doThing.apply(myobj);`
3. when a function is called from an object
	* `myObj.doThing();`
4. otherwise `this` is bound to global

Here, take my hand. Let's go over each scenario.

.center[![](2.png)]

---

## 1. `new` really ain't that fancy.

Javascript, in his younger years, wanted to be cool and *class*y, like his buddy java, so he threw in the `new` keyword. However, javascript don't do classes.

The short 'n simple version is this: all `new` does is make *any* function into a constructor. Among other things, this means that the function automatically creates a new object and binds that new object to the value `this`. After the function executes, it returns the newly created `this` object.

The end result is that it kinda seems like a class that created an instance, but it ain't. Trust me. We can talk about that next time. Just call it a **type** instead of class.

Here, take a look at this function:

	function WhatIsThis(property1){
		this.property1 = property1;
		console.log(this);
	}

---

## 1. `new` continued

As with any function `WhatIsThis()` can be called with `new`:

	> new WhatIsThis("i have no idea");
	< WhatIsThis {property1: "thing"}

A new empty object was created and bound to `this` in `WhatIsThis()`'s function environment. The environment looks like this:

	__WhatIsThisEnvironment__: {
		this: {},
		property1: "i have no idea"
	}

After the constructor completes execution, it returns the `this` object which now looks like this:

	{
		property1: "i have no idea",
		__proto__: WhatIsThis
	}

---

## 2. `call` and `apply`

There are 3 ways to invoke a function in javascript:

	WhatIsThis();
	WhatIsThis.call();
	WhatIsThis.apply();

`call` and `apply` are very similar, but we're going to look at `call`. The first argument `call` takes sets the `this` value of the function being called. Any subsequent arguments are passed to the calling function as parameters. 

We can pass in any object (including functions) to set as `this`:

	> var whatAboutThis = {
		  property1: "not it!"
	  };
	> WhatIsThis.call(whatAboutThis, "im it!");
	< WhatIsThis {property1: "im it!"}

Don't be afraid to set `this`! It seems weird, but it's part of javascript's DNA.

---

## 3. Kinda like a method I guess...

Functions can be assigned to objects, which effectively make them methods of that object. In familiar OOP style, calling a method of an object sets `this` to the object that the method belongs to. 

	> var letsTryThis = {
		  property1: "nothing to see here",
		  WhatIsThis: WhatIsThis
	  };
	> letsTryThis.WhatIsThis("SOMETHING TO SEE HERE!");
	< WhatIsThis {property1: "SOMETHING TO SEE HERE!"}

This should be the most familiar to devs coming from other languages.

.center[![](3.png)]

---

## 4. Oh javascript, please stop.

If none of these rules are met, javascript "helpfully" binds `this` to the global scope

	> WhatIsThis("oh no... oh no.");
	< Window {top: Window, window: Window, ... }
	> window.property1
	< "oh no... oh no."

Yeah... you don't want that to happen. Be careful out there.

.center[![](4.png)]

> Anonymous functions are bound to global by default. Keep this in mind if `this` suddenly isn't what you're expecting it to be.

---

## `this` is fluid. Use it.

Since `this` can be set on-the-fly, some interesting patterns are possible that allow for alternatives (or close approximations of) OOP. For instance, try composing objects instead of trying to emulate OOP inhertiance.

Take a look at `Federation.starship.BaseStarship()` and `Federation.starship.modules` on this page to see some examples of using `this` to compose objects (also called mix-ins).

---

## Recap

* `this` can be set in 4 different ways:
	* with the `new` keyword
	* with `call()` or `apply()`
	* by calling a function from an object
	* by defaulting to global
* Don't try to shoehorn OOP into javascript. Embrace the weirdness.
* Use `this`. It's flexible for a reason.
